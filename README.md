# Object Iteration Practice

> NOTE: This lab is designed to run in Glitch, not repl.it.

### The goal

In this lab, you'll start to deal with objects that organize data more and more clearly. We'll start with a list of favorite books, but each book is keyed to a person's name.

For example, to print Zara's favorite book, you'd use the code `console.log(favoriteBooks["zara"])`.

Open up iterate.js, code out solutions to the challenges, and run it to test your answers.
